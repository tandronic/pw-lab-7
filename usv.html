          <p class="blog-description">The Ștefan cel Mare University of Suceava (Romanian: Universitatea „Ștefan cel Mare” din Suceava), also known as
            University of Suceava, is a public university in Suceava, Romania founded in 1990. It was named in honor of the Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great.

          <h4>History</h4>
          <p class="blog-description">The first higher education school in Suceava was founded in 1963 as the Institute of Pedagogy. The institution had three faculties: Letters, Mathematics and Physics, and History and Geography. In 1984, it was transformed into the Sub-Engineering Institute, subordinated to the Technical University of Iași.

            In 1990, after officially given the university title by the Romanian government, the institution started to individualize throughout academic consolidation, didactic and scientific diversification, not least by getting better known nationally and internationally. In September 2008, the university was awarded with a High Confidence
            Rating by the executive bureau of ARACIS (Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Higher Education). In 2009, the Ștefan cel Mare University was
            ranked fourth on a list created by the Kienbaum Management Consultants firm in cooperation with Capital financial magazine about the images
            universities have among employers.</p>
